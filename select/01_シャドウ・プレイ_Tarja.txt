Looking at the mirror, asking questions with old, weary eyes
Once a girl who had no name dressed as an angel in disguise
From the corner of her bedroom light illuminates
Crawling shadows, cut out silhouettes
With the darkness, a dancing marionette

Smiled away with such a beauty ever seen before
Drowned by rain of thorns and petals falling at her curtain call
This mortal coil year after year recalled a sad charade
Like a shadow play we can't forget
In the darkness, a crying marionette

Make me believe
I must go on
Life is a warning
Don't want to risk it anymore
I want to leave
This place so wrong
It left me terrified to lose
All I am living for

Alone, imprisoned by the echoes of the empty hall
She made a deal with the enemy and let her fences fall
From the dust she build a door to frame new memories
Once a shadow, dancing with her fears
Lights the darkness, now the puppeteer

Make me believe
I must go on
Life is a warning
Don't want to risk it anymore
I want to leave
This place so wrong
It left me terrified to lose
All I am living for

There's a world inside we are holding the keys
One day at a time not trying to please
Tell me of anything that is lasting forever
You are your thoughts!
What are we waiting for?

Make me believe
I must go on
Life is a warning
Don't want to risk it anymore
I want to leave
This place so wrong
It left me terrified to lose
All I am living for

I want to leave
This place so wrong
It left me terrified to lose
All I am living for
Make me believe
I must go on
Life is a warning
Don't want to risk it anymore
